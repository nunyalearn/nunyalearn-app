// TODO: Migrate all learner-facing quiz + practice-test flows to new models before deprecating legacy.

This note tracks the pending migration effort from the legacy `LegacyQuiz` and `LegacyPracticeTest`
structures to the new Quiz/Practice Test v2 APIs. Do not implement new learner features on the
legacy stack—only bug fixes and documentation updates are permitted until migration completes.
